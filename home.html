                            Heart disease, kidney disease, and cancer are among the most prevalent and life-threatening health conditions, affecting millions of individuals worldwide each year. Despite significant advancements in medical treatments, it remains essential to understand the root causes of these diseases. Researchers continue to examine the intricate relationship between biological and genetic factors (such as gender, race, and age) and lifestyle behaviors (including physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) in order to better predict, prevent, and manage these conditions.

                            For our final project, we chose to explore a healthcare dataset that highlights key indicators associated with heart disease. This dataset, titled <em>"Indicators of Heart Disease"</em>, was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)—an ongoing nationwide survey that collects data on health-related behaviors and conditions from U.S. residents through annual telephone interviews.
                            The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle:

                            It contains 319,795 observations and 18 features, including: <strong>HeartDisease, BMI, Smoking, AlcoholDrinking, Stroke, PhysicalHealth, MentalHealth, DiffWalking, Sex, AgeCategory, Race, Diabetic, PhysicalActivity, GenHealth, SleepTime, Asthma, KidneyDisease</strong>, and <strong>SkinCancer</strong>.

                            Additionally, we’ve developed a prediction tool that assesses an individual’s likelihood of developing these conditions based on their personal health indicators. Try out the predictor <a href="predictor.html">here</a>.
